# MSc_floodtools
The scripts contained in MSc_floodtools were developed over the course of my master's thesis research. They were developed as small, limited function scripts in order to allow for maximum visibility at each stage. With additional testing and needed capacity to automatically convert input format types, the these tools could eventually be combined into a stronger, more continuous program. I imagined them to represent a very limited form of prototype for speeding up calibration and uncertainty analyses in HEC-RAS. The title of this thesis is "Evaluation of 1D/2D river flood simulation with HEC-RAS 5.0.3 considering change of boundary conditions," and it was conducted at the Technische Universit√§t Dresden from February-August 2017. The scripts are expected to be uploaded here in early 2018.
