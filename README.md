# MSc_floodtools
The scripts containted in MSc_floodtools were developed over the course of my master's thesis research. The title of this thesis, conducted at the Technische Universit√§t Dresden from February-August 2017, is "Evaluation of 1D/2D river flood simulation with HEC0RAS 5.0.3 considering change of boundary conditions." The scripts are expected to be uploaded here in fall 2017.
